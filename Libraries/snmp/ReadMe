Project home: http://gicl.cs.drexel.edu/people/sevy/snmp/snmp_package.html


This distribution contains the source for the Java SNMP package, as well as build scripts
for both GNU Make and Apache Ant. The following build targets are provided:

SNMPInquisitor: builds the SNMP Inquisitor application, which allows the querying of
SNMP-enabled hosts

SNMPPackage: builds the SNMP package into the snmp.jar file

SNMPDistribution: archives the source and build scripts into the snmp_source.zip file

SNMPTrapTest: builds the SNMP Trap Test application, which receives trap messages from
remote hosts and displays their contents

SNMPAgentTest: builds the SNMP Agent Test application, which demonstrates the use of
the package to construct an SNMP agent which listens for requests from an SNMP management
entity


To build any of these targets, use either
  ant <target-name>
if you have Apache Ant installed, or
  make <target-name>
if GNU make is available. Note that both build scripts assume that the javac and jar
executables are available in the current path.
