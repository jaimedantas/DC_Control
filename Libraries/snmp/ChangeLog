Changes from version 1.4.1 to 1.4.2:

- Removed font-key search from main apps to eliminate StringBuffer-to-String
  exception on app startup


Changes from version 1.4 to 1.4.1:

- Added agentIPAddress parameter to processTrap/processInformRequest methods 
  of SNMPv2TrapListener and SNMPv2InformRequestListener classes, so listeners 
  can accept or reject traps based on IP address since this isn't part of the
  v2 PDUs (thanks to Yong-Kiat Ng)

- Added communityName parameter to processTrap methods of SNMPTrapListener
  classes, so listeners can accept or reject traps based on community name
  (thanks to Kim Le)

- Added constructors permitting non-standard ports to be used for all exchanges


Changes from version 1.3 to 1.4:

- Replaced SNMPInteger values in Get and GetNext requests with SNMP Nulls

- Changed SNMP TimeTicks in trap sender timestamp to 1/100ths of second rather 
  than 1/1000ths
  
- Restricted SNMPTimeTicks to be 32-bit quantity (rather than arbitrarily large, 
  which caused problems with some receivers)

- Added PrintWriter for error reporting in AgentListener and TrapListener interfaces
  so error reporting can be directed as desired (rather than always to System.out)
  
- Changed internal representation of SNMPObjectIdentifier to array of longs to accept
  OID components up to 2^32 - 1 (thanks to Norman Elton)
  
- Changed toString() methods to utilize StringBuffer internally, for efficiency 
  (thanks to Philip Yarra)
  
- Added radix specification to SNMPInteger class toString() method

- Improved error handling:
  - Messages and PDUs perform more detailed qualification of contents, reporting more 
    specific errors (rather than passing on generic Java exception types)
  - Agent Interface now catches and reports all exceptions

- Fixed bug in SNMPv1AgentInterface, in which handled OIDs checked by reference 
  rather than by value (thanks to Roman Levandovsky)

- Added equals() and hashCode() methods to SNMP object subclasses for use in collections

- Added support for SNMPv2 traps and inform request messages. Note that as a result the
  1.4 version of the package is not directly backward-compatible with the 1.3 version,
  as all classes related to trap messages have been qualified to indicate whether the
  trap is a v1 or v2 trap. Thus applications which use traps will need to be changed
  to use the 1.4 version package; however, the changes should be simple textual 
  substitutions, e.g., changing all references to SNMPTrapPDU to SNMPv1TrapPDU.

- Added build scripts for GNU Make and Apache Ant
